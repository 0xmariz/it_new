                        <p class="white" >One of the most important responsibilities of an educational institution is bridging the gap between the industry and the students. The college facilitates this transition with the help of Industrial visits. Each year, the students are made to visit an industry or company that is related to their field of study. This helps them to get an idea about the actual scenario in industries and how engineers working in the industry apply their knowledge to solve various problems. These industrial visits encourage the students to step out of their comfort zone and start honing their skills so that they can be applied to real-world problems. The students can interact with the professionals and clarify any doubts that they have. They can get a clear and unbiased opinion about the industry from them and keep it in mind while making decisions in the future. This activity helps the students to benefit from the experience of the professionals and it provides insight into their chosen career path.
